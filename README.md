Coursework for my first graduate course, ME 392Q Data Analytics in Semiconductor Manufacturing with Dr. Dragan Djurdjanovic

Done entirely in Matlab. 

Homework 1 is a review of probability such as cumulative density functions. 

Homework 2 is about stationary signals. 

Homework 3 is about normality and using reflectance spectra to characterize dimensions. 

Homework 4 is about t, z, and f tests and also control charts. 

Homework 5 is about Principle Component Analysis and Exponentially Weighted Moving Average control charts. 

The midterm is about stationary signals, normality, t tests, and EWMA control charts. 

Homework 6 is about regression modeling and polynomial curve fitting. 

Homework 7 is about ARMA modeling and partial least square regression virtual metrology using k-fold validation. 

The final is about lithography overlay control and ridge regression virtual metrology using k-fold validation. I also trained a neural network for the metrology problem.
